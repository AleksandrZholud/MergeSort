# Merge Sort
This program shows how much time you should spend sorting with the merge algorithm.

In each variant we used array of one million random generated integers.
But the maximum value of elements are different:
1. max is 10 //all elements are 0-9
2. max is 100 000
3. max is 1 000 000 000

I know when array is minimal-sorted it takes less time to sort it.
Finally I saw that it is not very objective if you have an array of integers.

Output show you that it doesen't matter what integers you sorting, because algorithm is very fast.

I think now you think "ok, what about bigger array?"
I include next output with one thousand milion random elements sorting)
