# Merge Sort
This program shows how much time you should spend sorting with the merge algorithm.

I know if array is minimal-sorted it takes less time to sort it.
Lets check it out!

I have one million random generated integers in arrays. The maximum values will be different for pretending middle/minimal-sorted (1st and 2nd variant):
1. max is 10
2. max is 100 000
3. max is 1 000 000 000

Output show you that it doesn't matter what integers you sorting, because algorithm is very quickly.

Ok, what about bigger array, is it takes similar time?
I include next output with one hundred million random elements sorting)

How about sorting an array that's already sorted in reverse order?
